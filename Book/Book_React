DOM     :: Document Object Model
                DOM represents the content of XML and HTML in tree structure.

                For instance, open element tab of Inspect mode (Ctrl + Shift + i) for any website. 
                And you will see tree strcture which is DOM.
                Every browser uses some type of DOM structure.

declarative vs imperative programming:
    Imperative: Focuses on how to achieve a result, step by step.
    Declarative: Focuses on what result is desired, without specifying the step-by-step process.

react ->
        npx create-react-app app_name
            NOTE: app name must have all lowercase.

npm start -> to run react app.



ReactDOM.render(
        {parent node}, 
        document.getElementById("root")
      )

      --> if you try to insert 2 parent nodes inside first parameter. you will get error "wrap in enclosing tag". It occurs because one parent expected. you can have mulitple childs inside it without any problem.
      ex., <p>hi</p><p>no way</p>  -> error: enclosing needed
      ex., <div><p>hi</p><p>no way</p></div>  --> it will run nicely. without any problem.
