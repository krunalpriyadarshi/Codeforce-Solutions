Thread.start()          :   Start executing thread.
Thread.sleep(1000)      :   It will sleep the thread for given miliseconds.
Thread.join()           :   Wait for thread to complete. Before executing next line in main code.
Thread.join(100)        :   Wait for shortest duration between execution of thread or 100ms.
Thread.currentThread().getName()    :   Get current thread name.


Basic method to execute Threads:
            Class method:
                    class Runner extends Thread{
                        public void run(){
                            // logic for thread.
                        }
                    }
            
            Interface method:
                    class Runner implements Runnable{
                        @Override
                        public void run(){
                            // logic for thread.
                        }
                    }

Atomicity:
            In thread environment, an operation is atomicity if it executes without any interruption.

            For example:
                count++ operation read values from memory and increment it by 1 and save back to memory.
                
                In multi-thread environment, it is possible that thread1 read value and tread2 just reached to read value. but thread1 need to increment value and save back to memory. 

                Here, thread2 might read old value before thread1 process it completely. 

                Hence, it is not atomic operation.

Approach	    Visibility       Atomicity	   Thread-Safe
volatile	    ✅ Yes	        ❌ No	    ❌ No
synchronized	✅ Yes	        ✅ Yes	    ✅ Yes
AtomicInteger	✅ Yes	        ✅ Yes	    ✅ Yes

Volatile:
            In Tread environment, Treads stores variable in cache memory. Instead of reading from main memory.
            This is not thread-safe. Because, if one thread is updating the value of variable, other thread may not get updated value.
            Hence, in multi-thread environment, volatile keyword is used to make variable visibility to all threads.
            So each time when thread tries to read volatile variable, it will read from main memory instead of cache memory.    

            NOTE, volatile keyword is not used for atomicity. When multiple threads try to update counter/variable, it creats race-condition. 

Synchronized:
            When multiple threads create race condition to update variable, the thread become non-thread-safe.

            To make thread-safe, synchronized keyword is used.
            It will ensure that only one thread can access the variable at a time. Or put lock on variable until thread completes its operation.

            It is used to make method or block of code thread-safe.

            ex.,
                count++ is not atomic operation.
                So often value of count is not updated correctly in multi-thread environment.
                Hence, create a method increment() and make it synchronized and call it to increment count.

                this makes sure that only one thread can access increment() method at a time and update count value correctly.

            Code Block:
                public class Counter {
                    private int count = 0;

                    public synchronized void increment() {
                        count++;
                    }

                    public synchronized int getCount() {
                        return count;
                    }
                }

Lock:
            Lock is a mechanism that ensures only one thread can access the block of code.
            It is better than typical synchronized method/block as it only locks the block of code instead of whole method/block.
            
            ex.,
                class Solution{
                    private final Object lock = new Object();

                    public void transferFunds(){
                        synchronized(lock){
                            // logic to transfer funds.
                        }
                    }
                }
