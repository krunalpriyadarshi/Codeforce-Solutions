                    Method calls    :
                                Method calls are a fundamental concept in programming where one method (or function) invokes another.

Asymptotic Notations:
    The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the amount of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm. The efficiency is measured with the help of asymptotic notations.

    There are mainly three asymptotic notations:
        Big-O notation  -   Worst case complexity of an algorithm
        Theta notation  -   average-case complexity of an algorithm
        Omega notation  -   best case complexity of an algorithm

Algorithms  ::
                Kadane’s Algorithm - To find maximum subarray in single pass. Dynamic Programming.
                Sieve of Eratosthenes -  To find prime numbers with fastest way
