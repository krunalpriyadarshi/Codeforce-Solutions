                                input type= "{text, radio, checkbox, submit, button}"
                                placeholder attribute           = provide a hint or example text within an input field

                                                                for (radio or checkbox), same name attribute is used to create group of related elements.
                                                                Note: if 2 radio buttons have diff name; both radio can be selected. But if their name are same; only one of them can be selected.
                                label attribute                 = add associated text to input field. use same id of input inside <label for="same_id_of_input_field">
                                required attribute              = make field require. throw validation if field empty.
                                checked attribute               = select value as default for checkbox or radio button.
                                <form action="/.php">
                                        <label for="fname"> First Name: </label>
                                        <input required type= "text" id="fname" name="first name" value="Default value"><br>
                                        <label>
                                                <input type="radio" name="cat" value="kitty">
                                                kitty
                                        </label>

                                        // <fieldset>           = to group related form elements together. 
                                        //                      fieldset is block-level elements {display: block} with border. so newline will be added before and after this element starts.
                                        // <legend>             = give context to <fieldset>. Default: Nice looking (border + text)
                                        <fieldset>
                                                <legend>Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?</legend>
                                                        <label><input checked id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor"> Indoor</label>
                                                        <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
                                        </fieldset>

                                        // Both creats submit button and they will have same action: submitting form
                                        //       <button> is used flexible when it comes to styling and customization.
                                        //       because... you can include complex structure like HTML style tag such as <em>, <strong> etc to text of button which is not possible with <input>.
                                        //                ex., <button type="button">Click <strong>me</strong></button>
                                        <input type="submit" value="submit">
                                        <button>submit</button>
