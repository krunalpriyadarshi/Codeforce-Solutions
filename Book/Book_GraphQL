Rest API:
    It is a set of rules that defines how applications/devices are connected and communicates with each other.

    With Rest API, Underfetching and Overfetching issue comes:
        for ex.,
            we have 2 tables. 
                Books(id, name, desc, price, author_id, image)
                Author(id, name, desc)

                when we request for data and we get less data than we accepted creates underfetching issue. 
                ex., 
                    I request "kpriyadarshi.ca/Books/1" --> it will give record of id_book=1 from Books table. Hence we receive (id, name, desc, price, author_id, image) data.

                    unfortunetly, we also need data of Auhor but all we have is author_id.

                    Hence we have to send another request for Author details.
                    "kpriyadarshi.ca/Authors/author_id=1"

                    This issue is Underfetching.

                When we request for data and we get lot more data than we need creates Overfetching issue.
                ex.,
                    I request "kpriyadarshi.ca/Books/1" --> it will give record of id_book=1 from Books table. Hence we receive (id, name, desc, price, author_id, image) data.

                    But we only needed name and image from this Json. Other information such as desc, price, author_id etc., we got waste as we are not going to use it in our application. This issue is Overfetching.

    To overcome with this, we can use GraphQL:
        Query{
            Books(id:"1"){
                id,
                title,
                image,
                Author{
                    name,
                    id,
                    Books{
                        id,
                        title,
                        image
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        --> In single request, we are getting a Book's id, title, image, author's details and all books which were contributed by the author.

        It's not only reduce number of query but eliminated Overfetching and Underfetching issue.

        NOTE: Books table here is called Resource/Graph because it has records. And above Query connects with Resource/Graph to give results.
