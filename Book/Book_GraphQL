Rest API:
    It is a set of rules that defines how applications/devices are connected and communicates with each other.

    With Rest API, Underfetching and Overfetching issue comes:
        for ex.,
            we have 2 tables. 
                Books(id, name, desc, price, author_id, image)
                Author(id, name, desc)

                when we request for data and we get less data than we accepted creates underfetching issue. 
                ex., 
                    I request "kpriyadarshi.ca/Books/1" --> it will give record of id_book=1 from Books table. Hence we receive (id, name, desc, price, author_id, image) data.

                    unfortunetly, we also need data of Author but all we have is author_id.

                    Hence we have to send another request for Author details.
                    "kpriyadarshi.ca/Authors/author_id=1"

                    This issue is Underfetching.

                When we request for data and we get lot more data than we need creates Overfetching issue.
                ex.,
                    I request "kpriyadarshi.ca/Books/1" --> it will give record of id_book=1 from Books table. Hence we receive (id, name, desc, price, author_id, image) data.

                    But we only needed name and image from this Json. Other information such as desc, price, author_id etc., we got waste as we are not going to use it in our application. This issue is Overfetching.

    To overcome with this, we can use GraphQL:
        Query{
            Books(id:"1"){
                id,
                title,
                image,
                Author{
                    name,
                    id,
                    Books{
                        id,
                        title,
                        image
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        --> In single request, we are getting a Book's id, title, image, author's details and all books which were contributed by the author.

        It's not only reduce number of query but eliminated Overfetching and Underfetching issue.

        NOTE: Books table here is called Resource/Graph because it has records. And above Query connects with Resource/Graph to give results. 

GraphQL:
    GraphQL does not fetch all data from Resource/Graph instead only request resource will be fetched.
        ex.,
            query findGame{
                game{
                    id,
                    name,
                    company
                }
            }
            --> above query will return "id, name, company name of game from available 'Game' resource/graph".
            But restAPI will send all data of 'Game' table. And we have to do some sort of sorting to get only desired columns.

ReviewQuery ::
        Retrive requested column/value from Resource/ Graph.

        query NameOfQuery{
            TableName{
                Col1,
                Col2,
                Col3,..
            }
        }


Setup GraphQL:
    npm install @apollo/server graphql
            --> Install all dependencies.
    
    In Server Setup file:
        import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
        import { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';
                --> Used to create Server and assign a port to it.
        
        const server = new ApolloServer({
            // typeDefs
            // resolvers
        })
            -> Adviced to create 2 seperate files for typeDefs and Resolvers.
                typeDefs    :   To create schema and entry points.
                Resolvers   :   Contains function which used to handle all request. 
        
        typeDefs:
            schema definition:
                type GraphName{
                    colName: {int/ string/ boolean/ float/ ID}!
                }
                        --> data types          :   { int/ string/ boolean/ float/ ID }
                            ! (Exclamation mark):   not-null. 
                            []                  :   array definition

                            book_id: ID!
                                ID datatype with not null value.
                            [book_name]
                                An array of Book_name.
                            [book_name!]
                                An array of non-empty Book_name. But array can be empty.
                            [book_name!]!
                                A non-empty array of non-empty Book_name.

                            ex., 
                                // Resource/Graph defined:
                                type Review{
                                    id: ID!,
                                    rating: Int!
                                }

            Entry points definition:
                We have to define return type.
                    type Query{
                        GraphName: type-to-return
                    }        

                    ex.,    
                        type NameOfTheQuery{  
                            // An array of Review will be sent for a query to this entry point.
                            reviews: [Review] 
                            // Single result will be sent as response for given paramter value
                            review(id: ID!): Review
                        }

        Resolvers:
                Define an object which will be used to create ApolloServer.

                const resolver{
                    Query:{
                        reviews(){
                            return db.reviews   // Returning whole resource here:
                        }

                        review(_, args){        // 3 parameters: (parent_resolver, args ->Which is parameters object. , context)
                            return db.reviews.find((review)=> review.id=== args.id)
                        }
                        //based on value, we will match with resource value and it will be return:
                            // check on apollo server by:
                                // takes id and execute resolver's defined method
                                query reviews($id: ID!) {
                                    review(id: $id){
                                        id,
                                        rating
                                       }
                                   }
                                   // On variable tab of Apolloserver: pass id that will be used in above query
                                   {
                                       "id":"1",
                                   }
                    }
                }
        Resolver Chain: 






        import { typeDefs } from './schema.js'
                --> importing typeDefs from JS file where structure is defined.
        
        const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
            listen: { port: 4000 }
        })
        console.log('Server ready at port', 4000)



NodeJS commands:
    npm init
        ->  Initialize nodejs. But you have to provide information in Command line for package.json file.
    npm init -y 
    npm init --yes
        ->  Set default value of package.json file instead of entering.
    npm pkg set type= "module"   
        ->  To set type= "module" in package.json file.
            Because of this, we can use ES6 module.
    nodemon index.js
        ->  Rerun the specific file when changes are made. 
            For backend side, when changes are made. we need to rerun backend. To avoid that we gonna use nodemon.
