Scanner         :: Used for get User input.
                        eg.,
                            import java.util.scanner; 
                            Scanner sc= new Scanner(system.in);
                            String s= sc.nextLine();
                            --------------------------------------------
                                nextLine()      :: reads String value
                                nextInt()       :: reads int value
                                nextFloat()     :: reads float value
                                nextBoolean()   :: reads bool value
                                nextLong()      :: reads long value
                                nextShort()     :: reads short value
                                nextByte()      :: reads byte value
                                nextDouble()    :: reads double value

                                NOTE: 
                                A common issue when using the Scanner class in Java:
                                    nextInt() method only reads Integer and which result in, not reading "enter" or "new line" character.
                                    which was pressed after entring number. Hence use another nextLine() to read it before reading another line.
                                        ex.,
                                             Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
                                             int num = scanner.nextInt();
                                             scanner.nextLine();    // Consume the newline character
                                             String s= scanner.nextLine();
