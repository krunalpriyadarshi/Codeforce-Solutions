                                        NOTE: This element will take up the full height of the user's screen, regardless of the parent container's size

        Viewport Height (vh)    :: A value of 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height.
        Viewport Width (vw)     :: A value of 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.

                                        NOTE: If the viewport height is smaller than the width, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport height. 
                                                Similarly, if the viewport width is smaller than the height, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport width.
        Viewport Maximum (vmax) :: This unit is based on the larger dimension of the viewport.
                                        NOTE: If the viewport height is larger than the width, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of viewport height. 
                                                Similarly, if the viewport width is larger than the height, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of hte viewport width.
