        Viewport Width (vw)     :: A value of 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
        Viewport Minimum (vmin) :: unit is based on the smaller dimension of the viewport
                                        NOTE: If the viewport height is smaller than the width, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport height. 
                                                Similarly, if the viewport width is smaller than the height, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport width.
