                                        NOTE: If the viewport height is smaller than the width, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport height. 
                                                Similarly, if the viewport width is smaller than the height, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport width.

                                        NOTE: If the viewport height is larger than the width, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of viewport height. 
                                                Similarly, if the viewport width is larger than the height, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of hte viewport width.

                                then div="child" whose width is set to width:30% will convert to width:300px as parent width was 1000px.
