fallback font family        :: ensures font remains clear enough to read if the desired font is not available by system.
                                    ex.,
                                    font-family: "Preferred primary Font", Arial, sans-serif;
                                        if PrimaryFont is not available, system will use Arial font. even if this font is not available it will use avaiable option which is san-serif.
