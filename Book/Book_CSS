Fallback font family            :: Ensures font remains clear enough to read if the desired font is not available by system.
                                        ex., font-family: "Preferred primary Font", Arial, sans-serif;
                                                if PrimaryFont is not available, system will use Arial font. even if this font is not available it will use avaiable option which is san-serif.

An attribute selector           --> input[name="password"]{color:red; font-size:30px;}
                                        The above selects input elements with a name attribute value of password.

Viewport --> It is visible area of browser where content can be shown.
        NOTE: When you use viewport for responsive look; make sure to use max and min for height/width. Otherwise content looks strached.

        height: 100%;           :: sets the height of an element to 100% of its parent container's height.
                                        NOTE: Usually height of parent element is set by "height: 300px;"
        height: 100vh;          :: sets the height of an element to 100% of the viewport's height.
                                        NOTE: This element will take up the full height of the user's screen, regardless of the parent container's size

        Viewport Height (vh)    :: A value of 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height.
        Viewport Width (vw)     :: A value of 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
        Viewport Minimum (vmin) :: unit is based on the smaller dimension of the viewport
                                        NOTE: If the viewport height is smaller than the width, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport height. 
                                                Similarly, if the viewport width is smaller than the height, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport width.
        Viewport Maximum (vmax) :: This unit is based on the larger dimension of the viewport.
                                        NOTE: If the viewport height is larger than the width, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of viewport height. 
                                                Similarly, if the viewport width is larger than the height, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of hte viewport width.
rem (root em)   :: A unit of measurement relative to the root font size of the document
                        NOTE: It is used for responsive look.
em              :: A unit of measurement relative to the font size of the parent element
%               :: A unit of measurement relative to the % of parent property
                        ex.,
                                if a div="parent" has width:1000px and height:500px;
                                then div="child" whose width is set to width:30% will convert to width:300px as parent width was 1000px.
                                same with height as height:50% --> height:250px;

                        --> 75% represents color stops. ex.,"red 75%",75% of all background will be covered by red color.
                        
                        NOTE:-  linear-gradient produces an image.

CSS Box Model           :: Every element has Margin -> Border -> Padding -> Content
                        Border-collapsing: 
                                When x2 <div> are sequentially present in page with "margin:10px;".
                                Instead of showing 20px margin between two <div> :: { 10px bottom margin of 1st <div> and 10px top margin of 2nd <div> }
                                It shows 10px because bottom margin of 1st <div> and top-margin of 2nd <div> will collapse.  

                                For ex., if <div1 margin:20px> <div2 margin:10px> --> so margin will be 20px, not 10px because of Margin Collapsing

ex.1    Give <div> 100% of viewport height and width:
                To-do so we have to make sure parent elements <html> and <body> have 100% of viewport screen.
                As we know, these tag have some spacing associated with them by default by browser. so lets remove it.
                        html, body{
                                margin: 0px;
                                padding: 0px;
                        }
                Also, make sure to give these tag 100% of screen height. 
                If we do not do that parent element won't have 100% of screen so inherent element <div> won't have 100% of screen.
                        html, bodyy{
                                margin:0px;
                                padding: 0px;
                                height: 100vh;
                        }
                For <div>, we just gonna give it height because <div> is block level element so it has width=100% by default.
                        div{
                                height:100vh; or height:100%;
                                background-color: blue; /* to make div visible */
                        }
