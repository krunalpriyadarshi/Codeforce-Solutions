By default, Browser's user stylesheet has some margin/padding added to <HTML> and <Body> tag.

Fallback font family            :: Ensures font remains clear enough to read if the desired font is not available by system.
                                        ex., font-family: "Preferred primary Font", Arial, sans-serif;
                                                if PrimaryFont is not available, system will use Arial font. even if this font is not available it will use avaiable option which is san-serif.

An attribute selector           --> input[name="password"] {color:red;}
                                        The above selects input elements with a name attribute value of password.

Viewport --> It is visible area of browser where content can be shown.
        NOTE: When you use viewport for responsive look; make sure to use max and min for height/width. Otherwise content looks strached.

        height: 100%;           :: sets the height of an element to 100% of its parent container's height.
                                        NOTE: Usually height of parent element is set by "height: 300px;"
        height: 100vh;          :: sets the height of an element to 100% of the viewport's height.
                                        NOTE: This element will take up the full height of the user's screen, regardless of the parent container's size

        Viewport Height (vh)    :: A value of 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height.
        Viewport Width (vw)     :: A value of 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
        Viewport Minimum (vmin) :: unit is based on the smaller dimension of the viewport
                                        NOTE: If the viewport height is smaller than the width, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport height. 
                                                Similarly, if the viewport width is smaller than the height, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport width.
        Viewport Maximum (vmax) :: This unit is based on the larger dimension of the viewport.
                                        NOTE: If the viewport height is larger than the width, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of viewport height. 
                                                Similarly, if the viewport width is larger than the height, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of hte viewport width.
rem (root em)   :: A unit of measurement relative to the root font size of the document
                        NOTE: It is used for responsive look.
em              :: A unit of measurement relative to the font size of the parent element
%               :: A unit of measurement relative to the % of parent property
                        ex.,
                                if a div="parent" has width:1000px and height:500px;
                                then div="child" whose width is set to width:30% will convert to width:300px as parent width was 1000px.
                                same with height as height:50% --> height:250px;

                    Hue         ::  Adding ORIGINAL Color... (from 0 to 360)
                                        Hue red is at 0 degree; green is at 120 degree; blue is at 240 degree;
                    Saturation  ::  Intensity of a color from Grey to Original Color. (from 0% to 100%)
                    Lightness   ::  Brightness of a color from Complete Black to White; at 50% being netural Grey color. (from 0% to 100%)
                    Tint        ::  Adding WHITE Color
                    Shade       ::  Adding BLACK Color
                    Tone        ::  Adding GREY Color
Background      :: linear-gradient(45deg, red 75%, green, white);
                        --> 45deg will add angle to linear-gradient.
                        --> 75% represents color stops. ex.,"red 75%",75% of all background will be covered by red color.
                        
                        NOTE:-  linear-gradient produces an image.
                                By default, 180deg is set for linear-gradient.
Opacity         :: transparency of element
                        NOTE:   0 represent lowest value and 1 represent most transparent element.

CSS Box Model           :: Every element has Margin -> Border -> Padding -> Content
                        Border-collapsing: 
                                When x2 <div> are sequentially present in page with "margin:10px;".
                                Instead of showing 20px margin between two <div> :: { 10px bottom margin of 1st <div> and 10px top margin of 2nd <div> }
                                It shows 10px because bottom margin of 1st <div> and top-margin of 2nd <div> is collapsed.  

                                For ex., if <div1 margin:20px> <div2 margin:10px> --> so margin will be 20px, not 10px because of Margin Collapsing

box-sizing              :: By default, all elements have 'content-box' as default value.
                                Content-box: 
                                        When you set an element's width and height, it refers to the content area's dimensions only. Note: Padding and Borders are not included.
                                        But now, Padding and borders are added to the specified width and height. This can cause the total size of the element to be larger than expected.
                                        ex.,
                                                width: 200px;
                                                height: 100px;
                                                padding: 20px;
                                                border: 2px solid #000;
                                                --> Now, here element's width= width + padding + border = 200px + 40px + 4px = 244px
                                border-box:
                                        When you set an element's width and height, it includes the content area, padding, and borders in the specified dimensions.
                                        Padding and borders are accounted for within the specified width and height, ensuring that the total size of the element remains constant.
                                        ex.,
                                                width: 200px;
                                                height: 100px;
                                                padding: 20px;
                                                border: 2px solid #000;
                                                box-sizing: border-box;
                                                --> Now, here element's width = width = 200px
                                                It won't exceed this set width.
Border                  :: Every Element has border but it set to "none".       
                        SHORT HAND:
                        ex.,

                                border-left: 2px solid red;

                                                NOTE: You can set any corner of border.
                                                        ex.,

                                                                border-radious: 5px 6px 4px 7px;
                                        border-style    :: specify type of border such as {dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, none, hidden}

                                                                                border-top-style: solid;

ex.1    Give <div> 100% of viewport height and width:
                To-do so we have to make sure parent elements <html> and <body> have 100% of viewport screen.
                As we know, these tag have some spacing associated with them by default by browser. so lets remove it.
                        html, body{
                                margin: 0px;
                                padding: 0px;
                        }
                Also, make sure to give these tag 100% of screen height. 
                If we do not do that parent element won't have 100% of screen so inherent element <div> won't have 100% of screen.
                        html, body{
                                margin:0px;
                                padding: 0px;
                                height: 100vh;
                        }
                For <div>, we just gonna give it height because <div> is block level element so it has width=100% by default.
                        div{
                                height:100vh; or height:100%;
                                background-color: blue; /* to make div visible */
                        }
