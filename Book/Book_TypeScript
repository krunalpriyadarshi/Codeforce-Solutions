TS is superset to Js Or wrapped around JS.

TypeScript file can be converted into JS file by using 'tsc fileName.ts'
NOTE:
    Use --watch to avoid calling tsc command repetatively.
    command: 'tsc fileName.ts --watch'


Data Types:
    number
    boolean
    String
    null
    undefined
    void
    object
    array
    tuple
    
    syntex:
        let variableName: number = 23;

noImplicitAny :
    When data type is not assigned, it is by default set to 'any'.
    But 'any' is not type checked and it could lead to errors.

    To avoid that, use 'noImplicitAny' configuration to flag any implicit 'any' as an error.

    By enabling it in configration file:
    ex.,
        {
            "compilerOptions": {
                "noImplicitAny": true,
                // Other options...
            }
        }

    By passing it in command line:
    ex.,
        tsc --noImplicitAny main.ts
