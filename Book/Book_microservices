Microservices   
    It’s an approach to achieving loose coupling by creating multiple independent components, each with its own process. This enhances agility, scalability, usability, and enables parallel development. While making complex to built and achieve security.

MONOLITHIC V/S MICROSERVICES    :
            Parallel development    -
                Dev team can work independently on different componenets witout blocking development of other each other.
                
                In monolithic, it is hard to achieve compared to microservices.
                    - Tight coupling
                        - The same code base is shared in the application, and changing that might break other parts of the system.
                    - Limited tech choices:
                        - In monolithic, the same tech stack has to be used for the whole application.
                        - In microservices, each team can pick the best/optimized tech stack as per requirement.
                    - Testing:
                        - The whole application needs to be tested, which is time-consuming.
                    - Deployment:
                        - The whole application needs to be packaged and re-deployed.    
            
            Agility -
                It is ability to adapt changes quickly in terms of speed and responsiveness.
                
                In monolithic, components are thight couple compated to microservices which make it less agile.
                    - Any change in monolithic app can impact entire app which makes longer development, testing and deployment.
                    - Any change in microservices can impact independent service which makes it loose coupling and faster software development cycle.

            Scalibility -
                Ability to handle newly added resources without impacting performance. Resource can be traffic (new users and new data).

                In monolithic, if Order component gets more traffic then we need to scale whole application. In result, less used components such as Review component are created Which leads to more waste of resource and incresed costs. 

                In microservices, if order component gets more traffic we can only increse scale of that component. It is more efficient and cost-effective

            Usability   -
                How easily a system can be used, extended and maintained -- both from development and user experience perspective.

                Microservices have more edge because they are easier to maintain and scale.

            Complexity  -
                Microservices are more complex to create as it require more planning and infrastructure. Microservices have more issues/errors related to latency adn failure between services.

            Security    -
                Monolithics are easy to secure because of single entry point, simple data access and single point of failure.
                Microservices on other hand have multiple entry points and each entry points needs to be secure and handled each issue/error. Also, they've differenet data base which create data isolcation.

Why SpringBoot better to use for microservices?
            Springboot provides full range of built in features, integration and starter project. ex, dependency injection, auto-configuration etc.
            It also provides built in servers like Tomcat, Jetty during development.
            Additionally, production-ready features health check, admin etc.
            Last but not least, smooth cloud integration and containerization.

YAML V/S properties file:
            YAML file is lightweight and easy to read.
            Mainly used for configuration and automation.
            YAML is used for springboot configuration, Docker, Kubernets, CI/CD pipeline etc.

            properties file:
                // application.properties
                    server.port=8080
                    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
                    spring.datasource.username=sa
                    spring.datasource.password=password    
                    app.user[0]=Krunal
                    app.user[1]=kruz

            yml file:
                // application.yml
                    server:
                        port: 8080
                        datasource:
                            url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
                            username: sa
                            password: password
                    app:
                        user:
                            -Krunal
                            -kruz

Implement REST services:
            REST service entry points
                CRUD operations
                    Create  ->  HttpMethod.POST
                    Read    ->  HttpMethod.GET
                    Delete  ->  HttpMethod.DELETE
                    Update  ->  HttpMethod.PATCH/PUT
            Error/Exception handling   
            Document Rest services

DTO (Data Transfer Object)  :
            DTOs are used to fetch only required data instead of fetching entire entity object.

            Advantages of DTOs:
                ->  Encapsulate Entity   ::  
                        DTOs decouple the database layer from the API layer, preventing direct exposure of entity models.
                        Here, DTOs hide sensitive data such as Id, password from client application. 
                        DTOs do not update entity object.
                ->  Performance ::
                        DTOs send only required fields which reduce overall payload of server.
                        DTOs combine data from multiple entities and send single response object.
                ->  Security    ::
                        DTOs allow custom validations before processing request.
                        DTOs hide/filter sensitive information while sending response to presentation layer.

Response V/S ResponseEntity :
            Response will send only data retrieved from data access layer.
            Response entity will not only have response but also error code, error message and body.

                    // accountController.java
                    @RestController
                    public class accountController {

                        @GetMapping("hi")
                        public String welcome(){
                            return "Hello Krunal! <br/>This is your application. Enjoy!";
                        }
                    }
                Access endpoint by http://localhost:8080/hi address

            Step 3
                Create H2DATABASE and table inside:

                Step 3.1
                    Configure H2 in application.yml        
                        # application will run on port number 8080.
                        server:
                            port: 8080

                        # jdbc h2 setting up username, password and url
                        spring:
                            datasource:
                                url:  jdbc:h2:mem:testdb        #   testdb will be created in server memory.
                                username: sa                    #   default h2database id/password.
                                password: ''
                            
                        # setting up H2's web based console:
                        spring:
                            h2:
                                console:
                                    enabled: true               #   With enable console, dev can open web-based H2-console and execute SQL query.
                                                                #   If H2-console is disable, dev can't open it. Only way to validate query is through operation or log in application.

                        # Dialect which will act as translator to communicate between spring application and h2database.
                        spring:
                            jpa:
                                driverClassName: org.h2.Driver  #   H2 Driver will be used as translator between application and h2 database. where translator knows how to handle request like connecting, querying and updateing data.
                                hibernate:
                                    ddl-auto: update            #   for development
                                show-sql: true                  #   show sql query on console during run-time

            Step 4
                Create DATABASE and Entity class:
                Step 4.1
                    Create Database in .sql file:
                        // schema.sql
                        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `customer` ();
                        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `accounts` ();
                Step 4.2
                    Entity class:
                        // Customer.java
                        @Entity
                        @Table(name = "customer")
