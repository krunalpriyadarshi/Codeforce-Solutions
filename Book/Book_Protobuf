Protocol Buffers was created by Google to lower cost and increase speed for data transfer.
    ***             Protobuf        vs JSON     vs XML
    Size            -   Smallest    -   Medium  -   Largest
    Speed           -   Fastest     -   Medium  -   Slowest
    Human Readable  -   No          -   Yes     -   Yes
    Schema Requiredq-   Yes         -   No      -   No
    Browser Support -   Limited     -   Yes     -   Yes
    Debugging       -   Harder      -   Easy    -   Easy

Use Protobuf when you need
    -   Compact size : Binary format, smaller than JSON/ XML
    -   Fast serialization : Efficient encoding and decoding
    -   Type safety : Define object or schema 
    -   Backword compatibility : Easy updates without breaking anything
    -   Cross-language compatibility : Works across different languages

Disadvantage    
    -   Need compiler to encrypt or decrypt the data.
    -   Not human readable and fewer inspection tools.
    -   

When JSON is better fit than ProtoBuf?
    -   When you want data in human readable format.
    -   Server side application is written in JavaScript.
    -   If data is consumed by Web browser directly.
    -   When data is not tied to schema.
    -   the operational burden of running a different kind of network service is too great.

Install ProtoBuf compiler:  "brew install protoc"
