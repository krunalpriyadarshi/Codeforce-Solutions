gitlab Architecture: 
    GitLab Server:
        - Manages Projects, repositories, users and permissions.
        - Knows which jobs/ tasks needs to be executed.
    GitLab Runner:
    - Receives jobs/ tasks from GitLab servers.
    - Executes the jobs/ tasks.
    - Uses different executors to run the jobs/ tasks. (docker, shell, kubernetes etc)
        - Docker executor:
            - Creates a fresh docker container for each job/ task.
            - Runs all job scripts: command inside the container.
            - Destroys the container after job is done.
    Reporting:
    - Gitlab runner sends logs, artifacts and job status back to gitlab server.

Artifacts: Mechanism to pass files between jobs.

Linux shell commands: ??? learn about it.
