Before applying any Join operations try to use "Any", "EXISTS", "ALL" operations. As they are faster than Join operations.

IsNull(expression, value)   :
            if expression is NULL then return value else return expression.

            UnitsOnOrder column can contains NULL value.
            In case, we want to calculate totalUnitPrice then we need unitsOnOrder value.
            So we want to handle NULL value as 0 in calculation.
            Because NULL value in calculation will return NULL value and we want to avoid that.

            ex.,
                SELECT 
                    ProductName, 
                    UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
                FROM Products;  

COALESCE(val1, val2, ...)   :
            Return first not null value from array:
            ex., 
                COALESCE(null, null, 1, 2) => 1
                COALESCE(null, null, null, 2) => 2
                COALESCE(null, null, null, null) => ""

            Use of COALESCE in SQL query:
            ex.,
                SELECT 
                    ProductName, 
                    UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0))
                FROM Products;

LAG(CoulmnName, steps, AlternativeOfNullVal) Over(OrderByQuery):
            LAG function is used to check previous row's column value.
            For example, we can use it to fetch previous records data and perform logic on it.

            ex.,
                // Check if previous row has same value or not.
                select
                    num,
                    lag(num, 1) as prev_num
                from logs;

                // check if previous date's temp was lesser than this. 
                NOTE: records might not be sorted based on date so it's better to sort them by date. Hence use over() 
                select 
                    temp,
                    lag(temp, 1) over(order by date asc) as prev_temp
                from tempLogs;
                
Hot to kill process on port 3306:
    --  run CMD as administrator: 
            netstat -ano | findstr :3306
    -- in last column there will be PID. remember that number.
            ex.,
                C:\Windows\System32>netstat -ano | findstr :3306
                TCP    0.0.0.0:3306           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       5296
                TCP    0.0.0.0:33060          0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       5296
                TCP    [::]:3306              [::]:0                 LISTENING       5296
                TCP    [::]:33060             [::]:0                 LISTENING       5296
                << HERE PID NUMBER IS "5296" >>
    --  run below terminal code to kill task with PID 5296
            taskkill /PID xxxx
        <OR>
        Go to the Task Manager and go to details. Now search for the PID and kill the process.

Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to.
