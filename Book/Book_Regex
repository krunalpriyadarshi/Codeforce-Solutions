lookahead   :: 
                Used to check whether a character/string comes after a certain character/string.
                It allows Regex within its syntex.
                    Syntex: 
                        (?= (REGEX))
                        (?! (REGEX))
                    ex.,
                        a(?=b)
                            a followed by b.
                        a(?!b)
                            a not followed by b.

lookbehind  ::  
                Used to check whether a character/string comes before a certain character/string.
                It does not allow Regex to be used within its syntex.
                    Syntex:
                        (?<= (TEXT))
                        (?<! (TEXT))
                    ex.,
                        (?<= a)b
                            b proceed by a.
                        (?<! a)b
                            b not proceed by a.
